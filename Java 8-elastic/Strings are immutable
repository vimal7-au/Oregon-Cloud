String is immutable for several reasons, here is a summary:

Security: 
parameters are typically represented as String in network connections, database connection urls, usernames/passwords etc. If it were mutable, these parameters could be easily changed.

Synchronization and concurrency: 
making String immutable automatically makes them thread safe thereby solving the synchronization issues.

Caching Or Pooling : when compiler optimizes your String objects, it sees that if two objects have same value (a="test", and b="test") and thus you need only one string object (for both a and b, these two will point to the same object).

Class loading: String is used as arguments for class loading. If mutable, it could result in wrong class being loaded (because mutable objects change their state).

Differences Between Static Binding And Dynamic Binding In Java :

The above findings can be summarized like below.

Static Binding	                                                   Dynamic Binding
It is a binding that happens at compile time.	            It is a binding that happens at run time.
Actual object is not used for binding.	                    Actual object is used for binding.
It is also called early binding because binding 
happens during compilation.	                                It is also called late binding because binding happens at run time.
Method overloading is the best example of static binding.	Method overriding is the best example of dynamic binding.
Private, static and final methods show static binding. 
Because, they can not be overridden.	                     Other than private, static and final methods show       dynamic                                                      dynamic binding. Because, they can be overridden.

Java 8 enables us to add non-abstract method implementations to interfaces by utilizing the default keyword. 
This feature is also known as Extension Methods.



Functional Interfaces

How does lambda expressions fit into Javas type system? Each lambda corresponds to a given type, specified by an interface. A so called functional interface must contain exactly one abstract method declaration. Each lambda expression of that type will be matched to this abstract method. Since default methods are not abstract you're free to add default methods to your functional interface.

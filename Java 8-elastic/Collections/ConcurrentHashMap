ConcurrentHashMap




Putting key-value pair: 

1. Putting key-value pair in ConcurrentHashMap requires first identifying exact index in 
    Segment array. 
    (Once Segment array index is identified, Now flow will be exactly same as putting the data in 
    hashmap/hashtable.) 
2. After identifying index in Segment array, next task is to identify index of internal bucket/array 
    present in internal hashmap as shown in figure above. 
 3. After identying bucket(internal array index), iterate key-value pairs and check each key with key 
    to store, wherever match is found replace stored value with value to store.
    If there is no match, store key-value pair at the last of list.


Getting key-value pair:

1. Getting key-value pair in ConcurrentHashMap requires first identifying exact index in 
    Segment array. 
    (Once Segment array index is identified, Now flow will be exactly same as getting the data from 
    hashmap/hashtable.) 
2. After identifying index in Segment array, next task is to identify index of internal bucket/array 
    present in internal hashmap as shown in figure above. 
3. After identying bucket(internal array index), iterate key-value pairs and match each key with 
    given key, wherever match is found return value stored against key.
    If there is no match, return null.

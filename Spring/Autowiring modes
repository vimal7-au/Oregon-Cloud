Autowiring modes


no

This option is default for spring framework and it means that autowiring is OFF. You have to explicitly set the dependencies using <property> tags in bean definitions.

byName

This option enables the dependency injection based on bean names. When autowiring a property in bean, property name is used for searching a matching bean definition in configuration file. If such bean is found, it is injected in property. If no such bean is found, a error is raised.

byType

This option enables the dependency injection based on bean types. When autowiring a property in bean, property’s class type is used for searching a matching bean definition in configuration file. If such bean is found, it is injected in property. If no such bean is found, a error is raised.

constructor

Autowiring by constructor is similar to byType, but applies to constructor arguments. In autowire enabled bean, it will look for class type of constructor arguments, and then do a autowire bytype on all constructor arguments. Please note that if there isn’t exactly one bean of the constructor argument type in the container, a fatal error is raised.

autodetect

Autowiring by autodetect uses either of two modes i.e. constructor or byType modes. First it will try to look for valid constructor with arguments, If found the constructor mode is chosen. If there is no constructor defined in bean, or explicit default no-args constructor is present, the autowire byType mode is chosen.

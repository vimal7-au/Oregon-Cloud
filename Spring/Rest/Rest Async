Rest Async



First – let’s go over the rules – @Async has two limitations:

it must be applied to public methods only
self-invocation – calling the async method from within the same class – won’t work




Asynchronous support introduced in Servlet 3.0 offers the possibility to process an HTTP request in another thread. This is specially interesting when you have a long running task, since while another thread processes this request, the container thread is freed and can continue serving other requests.

IGW and NAT Difference


An Internet Gateway (IGW) allows resources within your VPC to access the internet, and vice versa. In order for this to happen, there needs to be a routing table entry allowing a subnet to access the IGW.
That is to say - an IGW allows resources within your public subnet to access the internet, and the internet to access said resources.
A NAT Gateway does something similar, but with two main differences:
It allows resources in a private subnet to access the internet (think yum updates, external database connections, wget calls, etc), and
it only works one way. The internet at large cannot get through your NAT to your private resources unless you explicitly allow it.




IGW doesn't provide public ips, those are assigned by EC2 separately. An instance can have a public IP assigned without actually being able to route to the internet through a gateway.

Additionally a NAT gateway:
Uses an EIP
Exists in a subnet
Cannot be used by an instance in that subnet (you need to route to the NAT gateway from another subnet)
Requires an IGW (the NAT gateway routes to an IGW to access the internet)
